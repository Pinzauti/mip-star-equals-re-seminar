\section{$\text{RE} \subseteq \text{MIP}^*$}
\epigraph{Our field is still in its embryonic stage. It's great that we haven't been around
for 2000 years. We are still at a stage where very, very important results occur
in front of our eyes.}{Michael Rabin, on computer science}

Finally we have all the ingredients to state our result and its consequences.
In order to prove that MIP*=RE of course we need to show both senses, and luckily for us one of it its trivial.

\begin{theorem}
    \begin{equation}
    \text{MIP}^{*} \subseteq \text{RE} 
    \end{equation}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    This inclusion follows since the supremum in~\ref{defn:entangled-value} can be approximated from below by performing an exhaustive search in increasing dimension and with increasing accuracy.
\end{proof}
We would like then to prove that $\text{RE} \subseteq \text{MIP}^{*}$.
