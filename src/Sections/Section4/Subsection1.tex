\subsection{Halting problem}

\begin{theorem}
    The halting problem $H$ is RE-complete~\cite{Algorithms}.
\begin{proof}
    Let $L$ be any recursively enumerable language. Assume $M$ accepts $L$. Clearly, one can decide whether $x \in L$ by asking if $M: x \in H$. This reduction is clearly computable. Hence all recursively enumerable languages are reducible to $H$.
\end{proof}
\end{theorem}
