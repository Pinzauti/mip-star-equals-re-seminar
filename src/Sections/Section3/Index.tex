\section{Interactive proofs and nonlocal games}
\epigraph{We have learnt that it is possible to fight entanglement with entanglement.}{John Preskill}

In this chapter we are going to introduce interactive proofs and discussing their complexity (and hence their power). Then we are going to define nonlocal games, using the classical, quantum, and quantum commuting correlation formalism. We will show that interactive proofs and nonlocal games are isomorphic and therefore what happens in the world of complexity theory has deep consequence also in the world of physics.
