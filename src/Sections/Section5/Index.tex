\section{Connes embedding problem}
\epigraph{I would like to make a confession which may seem immoral: I do not believe absolutely in Hilbert space any more.}{John von Neumann, letter to Garrett Birkhoff, 1935}

The goal of this section is to give an overlook of the link between Tsirelson's problem and Connes embedding problem. Before doing that we are going to give a definition of a Von Neumann algebra. Note that everything will be intentionally not formal at all.
