\subsection{The postulates}
We shall start with a general overview of the formulation of the postulates of quantum mechanics from~\cite{Shankar} and~\cite{NielsenChuang}. Needles to say, everything could in theory be reconstructed from scratch from these. It is fundamental then to have them clear in mind, as those are the stones of all the formalism we are going to build and all the tools we are going to use. 
\begin{postulate}\label{postulate:1}
Associated to any isolated physical system is a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ known as the \emph{state space} of the
system. The system is completely described by its \emph{state vector} $\ket{\psi(t)}$, which is a unit
vector in the systemâ€™s state space.~\cite{Shankar}
\end{postulate}
\begin{postulate}\label{postulate:2}
The time evolution of the state of a closed quantum system is described by a
unitary operator. That is, for any evolution of the closed system there exists
a unitary operator $\widehat{U}(t_2,t_1)$ such that if the initial state of the system is $\ket{\psi(t_1)}$ then
after the evolution the state of the system will be:
\begin{equation*}
    \ket{\psi(t_2)} = \hat{U}(t_2,t_1) \ket{\psi(t_1)} \quad \text{with} \quad \hat{U}^\dagger\hat{U} = \hat{\mathbb{I}}\,.
\end{equation*}~\cite{Shankar}
\end{postulate}
\begin{postulate}\label{postulate:3}
Quantum measurements are described by a collection $\{\hat{M}_m\}$ of
measurement operators. These are operators acting on the state space of the
system being measured. The index $m$ refers to the measurement outcomes that
may occur in the experiment. If the state of the quantum system is $\ket{\psi(t)}$
immediately before the measurement then the probability that result m occurs is given by
\begin{equation*}
    p(m) = \braket{ \psi | \hat{M}^\dagger_m \hat{M}_m | \psi}
\end{equation*}
and the state of the system after the measurement is
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{\hat{M}_m\ket{\psi}}{\braket{\psi | \hat{M}^\dagger_m \hat{M}_m | \psi}}\,.
\end{equation*}
The measurement operators satisfy the \emph{completeness equation}
\begin{equation*}
    \sum_m \hat{M}_m^\dagger \hat{M}_m = \hat{\mathbb{I}}
\end{equation*}
which express the fact that, if the states are normalized (and that will be always required), probabilities sum to one: 
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:normalization}
    \sum_m p(m) = \sum_m \braket{ \psi | \hat{M}^\dagger_m \hat{M}_m | \psi} = \sum_m \braket{\psi | \psi} = 1\,.
    \end{equation}
\end{postulate} 
\begin{postulate}\label{postulate:4}
The state space of a composite physical system is the tensor product
of the state spaces of the component physical systems. If we have systems numbered $1$ through $N$:
\begin{equation*}
   \mathcal{H} = \bigotimes_{i=1}^{N}\,\mathcal{H}_i \quad  \text{and} \quad \dim\mathcal{H} = \prod_{i=1}^N \dim\mathcal{H}_i\,.
\end{equation*}
\end{postulate}
