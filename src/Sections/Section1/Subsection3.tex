\subsection{Entanglement}
Consider two arbitrary quantum systems $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, with respective Hilbert spaces $\mathcal{H}_{Q_1}$ and $\mathcal{H}_{Q_2}.$ The Hilbert space of the composite system is the tensor product: 
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{H}_{Q_1} \otimes \mathcal{H}_{Q_2}\,,
\end{equation*}
if the first system is in state $\ket{\psi}_{Q_1}$ and the second in state $\ket{\psi}_{Q_2}$ the state of the composite system is
\begin{equation}
    \ket{\psi}_{Q_1} \otimes \ket{\psi}_{Q_2}\,.
\end{equation}
States of the composite system that can be represented in this form are called \emph{separable states} while
\begin{defn}
A composite system such that $\ket{QR} \neq \otimes_i \ket{Q_i}$ is an \emph{entangled state}~\cite{verrucchi}.
\end{defn}
