\section{Tsirelson's problem}
\epigraph{Natura non facit saltus.}{Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz}

Before stating the problem, we need to give a set of definitions. Despite the sometimes heavy notation, what we are going to define is pretty simple. We have two separated\footnote{Very separated: through all the seminar we are going to assume both the measurements to occur, using the language of relativity, in a in a causally disconnected manner.} systems $A$ and $B$ that receive two inputs $x,y$ from a given set $n$ and produce\footnote{The output simply depends on the measure performed by those systems on the inputs.} two (separated) outputs $a,b \in k$. We want to describe the behavior of the system, namely its $(n,k)-correlation$, which is a probability $p(a,b | x,y)$. As we don't want to be tied to the specific inputs, we focus in set of correlations, namely $p(a,b | x,y) \quad \forall x, y \quad \forall a,b$. 

It goes without saying that the depending on the formalism and the models that we use, this correlation changes. In the following sections we are going to describe the different type of correlations and most importantly the relationship between them.
