## Abstract
MIP*=RE is a breakthrough result, shaking the world of physics, mathematics and computer science, all at once. Results like this are exceptionally rare, and trying to overcome the complexity of them to grasp the deep meaning behind them is something definitely worth it. 
   
We start with a brief overlook of the fundamental concepts needed to understand the work. While some basic knowledge of quantum mechanics and quantum computing is taken for granted, we introduce some key points which could be unknown as a bit more specific. 
 
We then give a holistic overview of the result and of its chain of implications. After that we investigate in more detail why this chain of implications occurs. In all of this, we don't provide a formal proof of the main result, as it would cannibalize all the work given its length and technicality. 
    
Of the chain of implications, we mainly focus on the computer science side, namely the relation between Tsirelsonâ€™s problem and the complexity of non-local games. Connes embedding problem is a wonderful result, which is worth presenting, however we will skip the details, as more related to quantum field theory and mathematics than computer science.
